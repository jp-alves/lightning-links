# ⚡ Lightning Links

A handcrafted, privacy-focused New Tab page built for simplicity and speed.

I created Lightning Links because I wanted a dashboard that felt like a tool, not a product. It is a lightweight alternative to complex new tab extensions, designed to do one thing well: get you to your favorite websites instantly.

## 📖 Why this exists

For a long time, I was a fan of **Speed Dial 2**. It was great, until it wasn't.

Over time, it started adding features that felt unnecessary for a simple new tab page, for example, things like AI integration (Voila), clocks, notes, and a "focus mode" that actually disrupted muscle memory by shifting the position of the dials. The tool started to feel bloated, and the features began to get in the way of the main idea: speed.

I also believe that basic customization shouldn't be locked behind a paywall. Changing your background image is a fundamental part of making a browser your own, and it shouldn't be a "Pro" feature.

Lightning Links is my attempt to return to basics. No AI, no subscriptions, no shifting layouts, just your links, exactly where you left them.

## 🚀 Features

* **Instant Load:** Optimized to render the moment you open a tab.
* **Smart Preload:** Uses CSS variables to paint the layout immediately, preventing the "white flash" on startup.
* **Drag & Drop:** Intuitively reorder your shortcuts to match your workflow.
* **Fully Customizable:**
    * Adjust column count, dial size, and spacing.
    * Upload custom backgrounds or choose from the included presets.
* **Privacy First:** **No data leaves your device.** All shortcuts and settings are saved in your browser's `localStorage`.
* **Import/Export:** Easily backup your configuration or move it to another computer.
* **Zero Bloat:** No AI assistants, no analytics, and no unnecessary tracking.

## 🏞️ Credits & Tips

### Background Images
The beautiful landscape backgrounds included in this extension are from the **National Park Service**. They were sourced from the "Find Your Park" album on Flickr.

### Custom Backgrounds
You can upload any image you want as a background. However, to keep the extension feeling "lightning" fast, file size matters.
* **Pro Tip:** If you are using your own image, I recommend running it through **[TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)** (or a similar compressor) before uploading. It significantly reduces file size without losing quality, ensuring your new tab loads instantly.
